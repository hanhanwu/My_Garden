Hey, it's Miss Mooncake's story time!

That was a Sunday in an early Autumn, the air was filled with mixed fragant scents. Lady H. had been sitting in her office more than 1 week in order to find all the missing labels for more than 30 types of leaves... Her assistants came one after another to report garden business, and each one brought in an aromatic air to the office. Lady H. didn't notice anything unusual until the 5th girl Diana came in. "Diana! You applied perfume today!? I thought you were too sensitive to the scent!?". "I thought so too!", Diana replied with a big smile and shinning eyes, "But Garden Market gave us 99% discounts to buy the latest summer design, I had never seen such cheap price. Decided to give it a try and I love it!". "Oh, I'm glad to hear that! ... Wait a min, Garden Market is giving out perfume almost for free!? Why?". "Remeber we had harvested 300% more summer flowers this year? Garden Market made much more perfume than they can sell, fincally decided to give them out at a low price". "I see. Hmm... maybe we should do some sales forecasting before manufacturing".
