The performance of FLAML and Optuna in Table 1.1 came from their best experiment results. In order to give you a better view of the power of our seeds, we'd like to take you around to see the internal mechanism, as well as each experiment's details.

### Design Overview - FLAML

The overall design of FLAML is shown in Figure 1.2:

It has 2 major components:
* ML Layer contains the candidate learners.
* AutoML Layer includes a Resampling Strategy Proposer, a Learner Proposer, a Hyperparam & Sample Size Proposer and a Controller. This component controls the core logic of search strategy, with the goal of minimizing the total cost before finding a model with the lowest test error.
  * "Total Cost" means the total GPU time of training and validation using cross validation or holdout. This cost is also expected to increase as the test error decreases.

Now let's look into each step:

<b>Step 0 - Resampling Strategy</b>: It's a simple thresholding rule to choose between cross validation or holdout. According to FLAML researchers, cross validation is preferred over holdout for small sample size or large time budget.
* "Time Budget" means the total amount of time the user allows FLAML to run HPO.

<b>Step 1 - Learner Proposer</b>: A learner gets a higher priority if it makes improvement with less estimated cost. Meanwhile, every learner has a chance to be searched again since the estimation can be impresise.

<b>Step 2 - Hyperparam & Sample Size Proposer</b>: In this step, each learner chooses between increasing the sample size or trying out a new parameter set in order to make the improvement. By default, each new parameter set is searched by a randomized direct search strategy, CFO. We will show you more about it soon.

<b>Step 3 - Controller</b>: The controller will invoke the trial using the selected learner and observe both validation error as well as GPU time cost of the trial.

Step 1 ~ 3 are repeated by iterations until running out of the time budget.
