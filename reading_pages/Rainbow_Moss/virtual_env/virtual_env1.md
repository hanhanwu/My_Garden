# Data Science Python Virtual Environment

As python is the most popular data science language, it is a better practice to create a virtual environment for each new python project. Every virtual environment is like a rainbow moss flower, smaller size but independent and complete.

### The Pain of Python Open Sources

One of python's strengths is the popularity of open sources. They are free, easy to use, and most are implemented with efficient computing complexity, which is also why we often look for existing python packages before building by ourselves.

However, such flexibility and freedom brings in headaches too. Every new package might depend on some existing packages. Meanwhile, having so many open source developers, every package might get updated quickly. Then when you are installing a new python package, its dependencies might have conflicting versions with the packages you have already installed.

For example, Lady H. had Tensorflow 2.4 installed, but when she was installeing the latest Keras Tuner, it required Tensorflow 2.6. She could not simply upgrade to Tensorflow 2.6 because there are other packages depending on version 2.4 at the time.

It is painful to break the dependencies of packages whenever you need to install something new for a new project. Creating a separate virtual environment will solve the problem!

### How to Create Python Virtual Environments

By collecting this sprout, you can create python virtual environments regardless of your operating systems.

1. Download and install Anaconda for your OS: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html
2. Download and install PyCharm for your OS: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
  * Choose the "Community" version if you want the free one
3. Open PyCharm, find `Python Interpreter` under `Preferences` or `Settings` --> `Project`, click the little downward triangle, and click `Show All...`

</p>

4. Click the `+` button

</p>

5. Click `Conda Environment`, this will create a conda virtual environment for you. Therefore, here you need to choose the python version needed for the new environment, and update the "Location" to indicate where do you want to store this new virtual environment.

</p>

6. After the virtual environment successfully created, at the bottom right corner of your PyCharm, you will see its name, like this:

</p>

To list all the virtual environments you have created, type `conda env list` through PyCharm Terminal.

</p>

Just like the strength of the rainbow light, the more efforts you put into a project, the better outcome you will get, and after practicing on more and more projects, your achievements will be splendid as rainbow. Let's collect more sprouts and prepare for your bright future!
