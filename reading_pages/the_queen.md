She’s the queen of this garden, the very first collected asset.
  
  
Lady H. witnessed her birth at a freezing cold winter night. That was a stressful time in Lady H.’s life too, when she just moved to a new city to study, without family or friends around, heavy workload from school, pressures from internship hunting, illness, an unhealthy relationship, homesick and financial stress were attacking her all at once. 
  
As Lady H. later recalled, “I saw her petals started to open in the snow, the wind was strong but nothing could stop her from blooming. I was shocked by this magical plant, shocked by her existence and her vitality. At that moment, all of the anxieties in my mind had gone and a gush of hope flowing into my body. If she can stay strong in this harsh world, so do I.”
  
The queen is also known as "The Power of Dawn" because of her inspiring spirit. Everyone was surprised to see a blooming lotus in winter.

Normal lotus live between June and August, with their petals open every morning. One the opposite, the queen opens her buds at every winter night.

From figure 1.1, the differences are obvious to see.
