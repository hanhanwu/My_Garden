#### Task - Feature Engineering

Feature Engineering is a creative step. Besides using the existing data columns as features, users can add new features that might improve the model forecasting. The process of creating new features is called "feature engineering".

In order to create new features effectively, it's often worthy to explore the data for more insights first. Let's look at some basic methods Lady H. often uses in her data exploration.

##### Data Exploration - Univariate Analysis

Univariate analysis is to look at the statistics of each single data column, such as checking feature distribution and target distribution. This type of analysis provides an overall view of the data.
