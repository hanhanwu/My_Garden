In our Garden Market, you have seen the sprouts' power for building AutoML mini pipelines. They are mainly used in model selection with optimized parameters, some have data preprocessing power too. MLJar is a better choice for both model performance and time efficiency.

You also have seen the customized pipeline Lady H. built with the power from Luigi, Airflow and ZenML. While Luigi can be applied to smaller scale pipeline, Airflow and ZenML can be used for larger pipeline scale.

While Lady H. was exploring the power of sprouts, she had some great discussions on StackOverflow! Let's hear the story!

She started with asking for help about Airflow data transfer issue, not only she got the solution from Talgat but also got a suggestion from Hamza for trying out ZenML. Although, as ZenML's Co-Founder, it's natural for Hamza to recommend their products, Lady H. was looking for better tools than Luigi and Airflow at that time, Hamza's suggestion still provided her a hope.

Later it turned out this extra exploration is a good one! ZenML was showing a smooth Airflow setup to Lady H., and it not only solved Airflow data transfer issue but also provides a more flexible solution. Having gained so much excitment, the only challenge left for Lady H. was to show the DAG on Airflow UI. She asked Hamza again and got fast response, it was thrilling to hear that he's going to create a ticket for the problem solving. Finally, the problem solved! Such a great learning experience!

This is not the only great discussion Lady H. had with strangers who are also passionate about what they are doing. When time passed by, Lady H. is gaining more and more such inspiring stories, being enpowered to keep exploring and keep learning üíñ
