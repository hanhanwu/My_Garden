It is not a small amount of budget to run this garden. The cost of taking care of all the treasures, the spendings on garden decoration and maintenance, the payment of all the employees, and the investment in new technologies, all cost money.

In order to stay financially healthy, Lady H. opened this garden market to produce perfumes made from the garden plants, and sell them to the outside world. Because of the unique fragrance, fashional design as well as the outstanding client services, "Lady H." has become a popular perfume brand outside. People from different background all feel proud of having a bottle of Lady H.'s perfume.

The process of perfume making is automated, our garden market even developed 2 manufacturing pipelines to produce products.

## Garden Market's Pipelines
### Personalized Perfume Pipeline

This pipeline only produces customized perfumes for a few clients every year. Interested clients will be asked to share a story, it can be either a real story or a fictional one. If Lady H. loves the story, the client will get the personal design. After delierving the perfume, we will give the client a bank account number to let them decide how much money to pay. A billionaire may never get this perfume even if he's willing to pay a big fortune, and people with low income may still get the perfume even if only a few cents are available. The client selection all depends on Lady H.'s preference ðŸ˜‰

In order to make a personalized perfume, we will send a specialist to collect the requirements, personality and life stories of the client, then design the tailored product that fits best to the customer.

### Mass Production Pipeline

While the personalized perfume pipeline only serves a small group of clients, our mass prodution pipeline is for the general population. It makes a wide variety of perfumes, catering for a broad range of public tastes. With this pipeline, each type of perfume can be produced in batches and sold to large number of clients. The manufacturing process is an end-to-end automation, from flowers and fruits harvesting, to ingredients preprocessing, to perfume making, and till products' quality check, all rely on robots. 

Now, are you curious what kind of super power does Garden Market's sprouts have?
