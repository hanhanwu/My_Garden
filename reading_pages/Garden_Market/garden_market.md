It is not a small amount of budget to run this garden. The cost of taking care of the treasures, the cost of garden decoration and maintenance, the payment of all the employees, the investment in new technologies, etc., etc., all cost money.

In order to stay financially healthy, Lady H. opened this garden market to produce perfumes made from the garden flowers, and sell them to the outside world. Because of the unique fragrance, excellent quality, fashional design, as well as the outstanding client service, "Lady H." has become the top luxurious perfume brand in the outside world. People at different social classes all feel proud to have a bottle of Lady H.'s perfume.

The perfumes are making enough income for the garden. In order to fulfil the growing demand, the garden market has 2 pipelines to provide personalized design and large amount of production.
