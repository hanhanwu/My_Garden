It is not a small amount of budget to run this garden. The cost of taking care of the treasures, the cost of garden decoration and maintenance, the payment of all the employees, the investment in new technologies, etc., etc., all cost money.

In order to stay financially healthy, Lady H. opened this garden market to produce perfumes made from the garden flowers, and sell them to the outside world. Because of the unique fragrance, excellent quality, fashional design, as well as the outstanding client service, "Lady H." has become the top luxurious perfume brand in the outside world. People at different social classes all feel proud to have a bottle of Lady H.'s perfume.

In order to fulfil the growing demand, our garden market developed 2 manufacturing pipelines to provide personalized products and mass production.

### Personalized Perfume Pipeline

This pipeline only produces customized perfume for a few clients every year. Interested clients will be asked to share a real life story, if Lady H. loves the story, the client will get the personal design. After delierving the perfume, we will give the client a bank account number to let them decide how much money to pay. An upper class may never get this perfume even if a big fortune is willing to be paid, a lower class may get the perfume even if only a few cents are available. The client selection all depends on Lady H.'s preference.

In order to make a personalized perfume, we will send a specialist to collect the requirements, personality, life style, background and more life stories of the client, then design the tailored product that fits.

### Mass Production Pipeline

The garden market is making enough income, mainly depends on this pipeline. We make a wide variety of perfumes, catering for different tastes of the population. With this pipeline, each type of perfume can be produced in batches and sold to large number of clients. The manufacturing process is automated, from flowers and fruits harvesting, to ingredients preprocessing and selection, to perfume making, and till products' quality check, all rely on robots.
