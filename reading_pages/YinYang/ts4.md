## Explore Multivariate Time Series

Comparing with univariate time series, multivariate time series has more than 1 time dependent variables.

### About the Data

Have you ever wonder where do we store so many sprouts for garden visitors? We have a giant green warehouse, which contains thousands of rooms to grow sprouts! In order to maintain a healthy growing environment, every room of the green warehouse is monitored all the time. One of the monitoring metric is "occupancy", by checking the temperature, humidity, light, CO2 and humidity ratio, we can forecast whether a room has enough occupacy for new sprouts.

The data looks like this:

With temperature, humidity, light, CO2 and humidity ratio 5 variables being recorded every 1 minute, this dataset is a typical multivariate time series data.
