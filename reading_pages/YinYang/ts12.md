## Seasonality Detection

Different from data points detection, seasonality detection is to show seasonality pattern in the time series. In [time series decomposition][1], the disclosed seasonality pattern is one of the solutions. In this section, you will see more methods in displaying seasonality patterns.

### Kats Seasonality Detection

Kats has 2 main seasoanlity detection methods. ACF (autocorrelation function) Detector and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Detector.

#### ACF Seasonality Detector

The data input is sales data. Kats' ACF seasonality detection is as simple as the ACF plot below. Besides, it outputs whether there is seasonality and seasaonlity length (7 days in this case).

ACF is often used in ARIMA when people want to decide the parameter values. In ACF plot, each vertical bar indicates the degree of linear dependency between ith ts and i+gth ts, also known as "autocorrelation". Given a confidence level (such as 95%), out of the confidence interval (the threshold lines), the autocorrelation is significant.

Positive autocorrelation indicates moving towards the same direction, negative value indicates moving towards the opposite direction, 0 means the temporal dependencies is hard to find. As shown in the plot above, we are seeing repeated changes between significant positive autocorrelation and negative autocorrelation, which also indicates the seasoanlity in this time series.

#### FFT Seasonality Detector

FTT (Fast Fourier Transform) takes a time-based data, measures every possible cycle, and return the overall ‚Äúcycle recipe‚Äù (the amplitude, offset and rotation speed for every cycle that was found).

If we use sales data as an example, FFT detected seasonality pattern is shown with the purple curve. [Kats uses frequency and amplitude as the detection output][3].
