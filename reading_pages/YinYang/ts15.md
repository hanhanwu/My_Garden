In this ARIMA diagnostic plot:
1. We check the residual plot to see whether it's random, otherwise it means the model has left time series patterns unexplained.
2. By comparing the orange KDE cureve and the green standard normal distribution curve, the larger overlap the 2 curves have, the better model is.
3. Looking at the blue scatter plot and the red line in Q-Q plot, more overlap indicates a better model performance.
4. In correlogram, except lag 0, if we see any significant lag, it means there's seasonality left. In this case, we are seeing lag 7 has the most significant bar, this also aligns with [our decomposed time series observation][2] and the seasoanlity detected in [Kats ACF seasonality detector][1].

To consider seasonality in the model, we can use `SARIMA` which ad
