# Time Series Model Forecasting

It is straightforward to apply deep learning or classical machine learning models on time series data. At the same time, there are models and tools designed for time series forecasting specifically, but online tutorials often only contain partial information or even misleading guidance, the promotion of promising tools is not common either. Therefore, Lady H. decided to show the super power from some time series focused methods.

## Statistical Time Series Forecasting - (S)ARIMA

When it comes to time series forecasting, "ARIMA" is a popular method people often talk about, especially during data science interviews. But how many interviewees and even interviewers really used ARIMA in the work, and used well?

Many online tutorials are misleading is either because they are missing important knowledge or contain more complex and unnecessary information. What's more, they always choose [Air Passenger data as an example][1], which is too simple. One of the realities of time series forecasting is, same method applied to different datasets can lead to quite different model performance. 

So, Lady H. decided to show the ARIMA process she often applied that had been proved to be reliable on multiple time series problems.
