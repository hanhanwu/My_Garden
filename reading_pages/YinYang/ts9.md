## Changepoint Detection

As we saw in trend detection, the detected output are time points where the trend changes. Changepoint detection is also a method to detect time points where the probability distribution of a time series changes. In some libraries such as Greykite, trend detection is included in its changepoint detection. In Kats, they are seperated. Let's take a look at Kats changepoint detection first.

### Kats Changepoint Detection Methods

The experiments for Kats changepoint detection are shown with humidity and temperature time series data.

Wondering why sales data is not shown here? Because Kats changepoint detection didn't work well on our sales data, the output was too bad to be used in the demo... ðŸ˜…

#### CUSUM Detector

CUSUM Detector detects the up or down shift of means in the time series. Starting from an initial point, it calculates the CUSUM of means iteratively, and locate a changepoint where its previous CUSUM is maximized or minimized. 

The null hypothesis is `H0: There is no change in the mean`. We can decide to detect a single changepoint or multiple changepoints. Let's start from single changepoint detection!

##### Single Changepoint Detection

To use CUSUM Detector in Kats, we need to initialize the detector with a time series input as shown in Step 1, then we can write a function in Step 2 to load detector's parameters and plot the changepoint, finally Step 3 shows the output of increasing changepoint detection for both humidity and temperature data. The parameter `threshold` is the significance level for null hypothesis. As we can see, in temperature data, there is no significant change detected given 0.05 significance level.

Similarly, we can detect decreasing changepoint for the time series as shown below:

</p>

What's more, sometimes we only want to do the detection within part of the time series, so we can specify an interest window and the changepoint detection will only happen within the window. Of course, the detected result is only valid locally in the window but may not be valid in the whole time series.

##### Multiple Changepoints Detection

The secret to enable multiple changepoints detection with CUSUM Detector is to add a sliding window. When the window slide forward in a fixed step size, the detector will detect the changepoint within the window.

</p>

In this example, we are using window size as 2000 (meaning, there're 2000 records in the window) and step size as 800 to detect the increasing changepoints, the results are markded in red lines. As you can see below, some red lines are close together, if you want to avoid this happen, you can set a larger step size, so that there is less overlap between windows.

Similarly, here're the detected decreasing changepoints:
