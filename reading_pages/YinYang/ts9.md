## Changepoint Detection

As we saw in trend detection, time points were detected. Similarly, changepoint detection is also a method to detect time points, but instead of detection the trend changing points, it's trying to find time points where the probability distribution of a time series changes.

### Kats Changepoint Detection Methods

The experiments for Kats changepoint detection are shown with humidity and temperature time series data.

Wondering why sales data is not shown here? Because Kats changepoint detection didn't work well on the sales data, the output was too bad to be used in the demo... ðŸ˜…
