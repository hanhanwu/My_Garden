### Silverkite Template

Here's Silverkite architecture design, it looks like a complex system formed by various elements which are used for creating features and config models. However all these elements can be specified through Greykite config, in a simple way.

<i>Note: Statistical Volatity Models are not covered here.</i> 

How does Greykite config cover all these settings? Take a look at the following code:

1. `ModelComponentsParam` is where you can config feature generation and model settings.
   1. `seasonality` allows you to specify seasoanlity patterns, they will be converted to input features.
   2. `events` is where to specify special events that might be useful in forecasting, they are also in features format.
   3. `custom` is where to config models' settings.

</p>

2. `EvaluationPeriodParam` contains settings for backtesting and cross validation.
3. `MetadataParam` is where to describe your time series data input.

As shown below, to finish all the configuration, you only need to put all these settings in `ForecastConfig`:

In Lady H.'s opinion, the real selling point of Silverkite is its time series features, such as seasonality features, events features, etc. Models used in Silverkite are classical machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, etc. [Looking at Silverkite source code here][1], there's nothing special in model fitting. Same as applying classical machine learning models, it fits the model with training data and parameters.

After configuration, we can initialize a forecaster instance as simple as this:

</p>

Then running the grid search with cross validation to find an optimal forecating solution:

</p>

The cross validation output will show eavluation metrics values for each choice of parameter set. Which evaluation metrics to show is decided by yourself, as shown in the code above.
