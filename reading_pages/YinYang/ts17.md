### Silverkite Template

Here's Silverkite architecture design, it looks like a complex system formed by various elements which are used for creating features and config models. However all these elements can be specified through Greykite config, in a simple way.

<i>Note: Statistical Volatity Models are not covered here.</i> 

How does Greykite config cover all these settings? Take a look at the following code:

1. `ModelComponentsParam` is where you can config feature generation and model settings.
   1. `seasonality` allows you to specify seasoanlity patterns.
   2. `events` is where to specify special events that might be useful in the model forecasting.
   3. `custom` is where to config models' settings.
2. `EvaluationPeriodParam` contains settings for backtesting and cross validation.
3. `MetadataParam` is where to describe your time series data input.

As shown below, to finish all the configuration, you only need to put all these settings in `ForecastConfig`:
