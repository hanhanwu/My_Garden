## Greykite Time Series Forecast

Let's come back to our old friend Greykite. Looking at Table 3.2, comparing with the best result from ARIMA, Greykite's 2 templates all have made the improvement on both MAPE and R2. Sweet! Now let's dive deeper in Greykite forecasting!

### Overall Forecasting Process

The overall forecasting process always follow 3 general steps:

1. Config Step: In this step, you can config settings about data, feature generation and modeling.
2. Grid Search + CV: In this step, Greykite will tune model parameters with cross validation, using grid search. The returned optimized model will be trained on the whole training data set.
3. Backtest or Forecast: After getting the trained model, if you will predict the labeled testing data, then it's called as "Backtest"; if you need to forecast unlabelled data, then it is called as "Forecast".

This code only shows a baseline model, in order to get a satisfied model performance we need to add more customized configuration.
