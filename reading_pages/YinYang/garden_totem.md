What is evolution?

No matter how special a plant is in this garden, it repeats a life cycle of birth, growth, bloom, mundanity and death. In each cycle, when life reaches to the blooming point, that's also the start of languishing; however when it reaches to the bottom point (death), that's also the beginning of rebirth. As you can see, our garden totem, the lotus-skeleton is a representation of this cycle, and you can see it everywhere in the garden.

Antient Chinese summarized this repeated cycle as <b>Yin (é™°) Yang (é™½)</b>, "Yin" means the down point of the cycle while "Yang" means the up point. It's been considered as a universal law carried out by everything. 

A popular example is, life is filled with ups and downs. The down moments keep pushing us to self-reflect and to learn from the nonfulfillment, while the up moments award our hard working. By going through this up and down cycle again and again, human beings are becoming better and better. This is the process of evolution. Meanwhile, because we can never reach to a perfect status, this cycle will keep repeating.

Same to our garden plants. Their uniqueness and magic power is a result of evolution, and they are always undergoing the new advancement.

## Data Science in Time Series

In data science, we also study a type of "cycle", by discovering the repeated patterns in time, we're aiming at gaining more data insights and achieving better forecast results. The analysis on a sequence of data indexed by time, is called "Time Series".

<p align="center">ðŸŒ± <b>Sprouts Collection Time!</b> ðŸŒ±</p>

Our garden totem is not a plant and can't produce sprouts itself. However, Lady H. still wants to prepare a gift at this stop, so she invented this artificial sprout, which grows the same as other garden sprouts and as magical as them! Its superpower covers:

* Data Exploration in Time Series
* Time Series Detection of Trend, Seasonality, Changepoints and Outliers
* Time Series Forecasting

Now are you excited to see what's the super power of this compounded sprout? Let's go!
