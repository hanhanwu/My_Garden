What is evolution?

When Lady H. was on her journey of plants hunting, she observed a common pattern. That is, no matter how special a plant is, it repeats a life cycle of birth, growth, bloom, mundanity and death. In each cycle, when life reaches to the blooming point, that's also the start of languishing; however when it reaches to the bottom point (death), that's also the beginning of rebirth.

Antient Chinese had summarized this repeated cycle as <b>Yin (陰) Yang (陽)</b>. It's been considered as a universal law carried out by everything. 

A common observation of this law is, life is filled with ups and downs. The down moments in life keep pushing us to do self-reflection and to learn from the failures, the up moments pay off our past efforts but also reminds us of the new challenges. By going through this cycle again and again, human beings are becoming better and better. This is the process of evolution. Meanwhile, because we can never reach to a perfect status, this cycle will keep repeating.

Same idea applies to the plants in this graden. Because each of these species had gone through tons of such evolution cycles, they became unique and fabulous, and they are still improving along the time.
