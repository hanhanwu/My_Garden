### Prophet Template

Prophet doesn't have a cool design architecture as Silverkite, so Lady H. made one!

And, all the secrets are hidden in this formula!

Instead of considering the data's temporal dependency like (S)ARIMA, Prophet model frames the forecasting problem as a curve-fitting exercise by using a trend function `g(t)`, a seasonality function `s(t)`, a holiday function `h(t)` and the error term `Îµt`. The benefit of Prophet model is the flexibility that users can adjust model parameters with different assumptions about the trend, the seasonality or the holidays. Prophet is a convenient time series forecasting tool with insightful visualization, to learn more details check [Prophet paper][1]. Now let's see how can we use Prophet template in Greykite!

The difference mainly lies in the configuration settings.
* `seasonality_mode` is a unique parameter in Prophet template. It supports "additive" or "multiplilicative" modes. Mode "additive" is used when you assume the seasonality is constant over the time, Prophet will add seasoanlity to trend in the formula. Mode "multiplicative" is used when you assume the seasoanlity is time varying, and Prophet will multiply the seasonality with the trend.
