### Prophet Template

Prophet doesn't have a cool design architecture as Silverkite, so Lady H. made one!

And, all the secrets are hidden in this formula!

Instead of considering the data's temporal dependency like (S)ARIMA, Prophet model frames the forecasting problem as a curve-fitting exercise by using a trend function `g(t)`, a seasonality function `s(t)`, a holiday function `h(t)` and the error term `Îµt`. The benefit of Prophet model is the flexibility that users can adjust model parameters with different assumptions about the trend, the seasonality or the holidays. Prophet is a convenient time series forecasting tool with insightful visualization, to learn more details check [Prophet paper][1].
