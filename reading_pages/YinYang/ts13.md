## Kats vs Greykite

Kats might be one of the worst open source libraries Lady H. had ever used, because of its poor code design. At the same time, we can't say Kats is purely useless. But after living through all those detection experiments, Lady H. no longer thinks applying Kats to time series forecasting would be a good idea. So before we go to model forecasting topic, let's review a comparison between Kats and Greykite.

* <b>Code Design</b>: Greykite has much better code design than Kats, it appears in its flexible and smooth user experience, decent visualization and clear documentation. By comparison, Kats has bugs almost everywhere, weird visualization, incomplete and even incorrect code documentation. Using Kats, is a headache ðŸ˜“
* <b>Trend Detection</b>: [Kats trend detection][1] doesn't have attractive visualization and always gets a misleading warning in the output, but the algorithms used behind its trend detection are reasonable. [Greykite detects trend through trend changepoints][2], the output visualization looks fancy but sometimes confusing.
