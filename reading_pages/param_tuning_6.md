### Experiment 4 - HPO in Deep Learning

It was coincidence that, when Lady H. planned to end her HPO experiments, a type of new sprout discovered in the garden ðŸŒ±. The gardeners said this sprout contains the power called, Keras Tuner, which can be used in HPO of deep learning and sklearn estimators. "Ah! Deep Learning HPO, I haven't tried that out. Let me take a quick look", Lady H. thought.

#### A Glance of Graden Flowers

Every year, gardeners will bring in new flower species to decorate the garden. These flowers don't have any superpower as Lady H.'s treasures but their beauty 
is making the garden a real wonderland throughout 4 seasons. As a flower expert, Lady H. doesn't really need any tool to classify these beauties, but she loves to pick whatever handsome items as her dataset. So she opened her crystal ball to collect a sample of garden flowers.

There are 7169 flower observations in the training data and 1020 observations in the testing data. Each observation had been shapped into the same 300x300 resolution.
